> **Stop burning tokens. Stop losing context. Ship faster.**

A single binary that makes Claude Code, Cursor, and every other AI coding assistant **70–90% cheaper** to run — without dumbing them down.

If you've ever watched 30K tokens evaporate on a single file read, paid for "thinking" you didn't need, or re-explained the same project context after `/clear` for the fifth time today — this is for you.

---

## 🟢 Why Icemage

AI assistants are powerful but **wasteful by default**. Every time the AI opens a file, runs a command, or starts a new chat, it re-reads context it has seen many times and dumps full output into the conversation. Icemage sits quietly in the background and trims the noise before it ever reaches the AI:

- **Long files** → only the relevant slice
- **Noisy command output** → just the parts that matter
- **Web pages** → cached + summarised
- **Past decisions** → remembered across sessions so the AI doesn't ask twice
- **Repeated work** → results reused instead of recomputed

The AI keeps its full intelligence. Your wallet keeps more of its money.

## ✨ What's new

- **v2.0.10** - **Live mutual-awareness across parallel sessions, exact BPE token counting, and an honest savings line.** Parallel `icmg` sessions on one machine can now see each other — `presence` (heartbeat liveness with TTL), `bus` (a shared action stream), `lock` (advisory ownership for safe parallelism), `msg` (directed/broadcast messages), and `hot` (a shared key/value whiteboard) — all append-only and race-free, with a heartbeat hook auto-installed by `icmg init` so each session beats its presence every turn. `ICMG_WIRE_DIR` points the wire at a commonly-visible folder, so sessions whose `%APPDATA%` is not shared can still rendezvous. Opt-in exact tokenization: `icmg tokenizer download cl100k|o200k` plus `ICMG_TOKENIZER=bpe-cl100k` gives precise GPT-family token counts (the default heuristic is now character-class weighted for a closer estimate with no download). And `icmg savings` prints honest two-number session totals instead of a fabricated coverage percentage. Full automated suite passes (1541 checks).
- **v2.0.9** - **Crash-hardening for path-argument commands on Windows Server.** A latent crash class: the throwing `std::filesystem::absolute` / `weakly_canonical` reach the PathCch API-set, which fails to resolve on some Windows Server SKUs and raises `filesystem_error` 126, crashing any command that resolves a path argument (`context`, `graph`, `claudemd`, `plan`, `import`) on that host — even though `--version` and memory commands kept working. A new no-throw `core::absolutePath` helper (error-code overload + purely-lexical fallback) now backs eleven previously-unguarded sites, and `Config::projectDbPath` no longer calls the throwing `weakly_canonical`. Path-arg commands degrade to a lexical path instead of terminating. Full automated suite passes (1483 checks).
- **v2.0.8** - **Faster persona recall and leaner per-turn context.** Two token-efficiency improvements plus a test-harness fix. `icmg profile search "<query>"` now uses an FTS5 / bm25 index over the persona store instead of a substring scan, so cross-project profile/skill/note recall returns the most relevant entries first (graceful LIKE fallback when FTS5 is unavailable; the index self-syncs on every write with a one-time backfill). The per-prompt recall injector skips a memory slice whose topic is a near-duplicate of one already surfaced earlier in the same session (a file-backed Jaccard window, reset per session), so the same context is not re-spent turn after turn — completing the 7-component injection governor. And the test entrypoint sets `SetErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS)`, so subprocess-spawning tests no longer raise a transient drive-not-found dialog on Windows. Full automated suite passes (1480 checks).
- **v2.0.7** - **Persona continuity, source provenance, and a cluster of correctness fixes.** Two identity-agnostic capabilities plus long-session fixes. `icmg persona init` seeds a set of neutral continuity zones in the per-install persona DB; a SessionStart hook surfaces a user-defined wake-up protocol and a Stop hook nudges a notes-refresh on a meaningful turn, so an assistant's persisted context survives a fresh session or a context compaction — nothing is hardcoded, every zone is a template you fill. `icmg store --source "<who>"` and `icmg profile add --source "<who>"` tag where a piece of information came from; `recall` and `profile get`/`list` display it as `[from: <source>]` (free-text, defaults to `unknown`, metadata-only — it never affects BM25 ranking). Fixes: a corrupt global DB is recovered cleanly on startup instead of crashing every global command; the `persona` command no longer collides with its continuity `init` subcommand; the drive-not-found popup dismisser now matches by the dialog's body text, catching dialogs whose caption is empty rather than a bare `X:`; and a misplaced schema migration was moved to the correct per-DB array. Full automated suite passes (1437 checks).
- **v2.0.6** - **Long-session hardening round 2: cleaner prompt history, fixed internal-zone convention, deterministic tests.** Continued marathon testing surfaced a tight cluster of correctness fixes. `icmg prompt-capture` strips harness/hook-injected noise before recording, so the auto-built history holds what you actually typed — not machinery. The internal `_`-zone convention was silently broken (`slugify` dropped the leading underscore, so `_mode` collapsed to `mode`); `normalizeZone` now preserves it, and `qa-suggest`/`qa-frequent` correctly exclude internal zones from reuse. The mono test suite deletes stale `*_test.db` at startup so back-to-back runs are deterministic. `build.ps1`'s error scan matches only real MSVC `): error`/`LNK` lines. And every remaining `std::cin.rdbuf()` stdin reader is now isatty-guarded, completing the hook-hang hardening. Full automated suite passes (1420 checks).

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Download** the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ncmonx/icemage/releases) — `icmg-<version>-win-x64.zip` for Windows, `icmg-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` for Linux.
2. **Extract** the archive into any folder of your choice.
3. **Add the folder to your `PATH`** so the `icmg` command is available everywhere.
4. **Open your project** in a terminal and run:

   ```text
   icmg init
   ```

   That's it. The next time you launch Claude Code (or Cursor / Cline / Windsurf — see below), Icemage will quietly start trimming tokens.

## 🧰 What you'll actually use day-to-day

After install, the only command most people type is `icmg init` once per project. Everything else happens automatically. A few useful commands when you want to peek under the hood:

| Want to | Type |
|---|---|
| See how much you saved this month | `icmg savings` |
| See a chart in the terminal | `icmg savings --ascii` |
| Recall a past decision in this project | `icmg recall "<question>"` |
| Recall something from another project | `icmg cross-recall "<question>"` |
| Wake-up briefing for a fresh session | `icmg wake-up` |
| Update Icemage in place | `icmg update --apply` |
| Health-check the install | `icmg doctor` |

For the full menu run `icmg --help`.

## 🤖 Works with

- **Claude Code** (primary target — best-tested)
- **Cursor** — drop-in via the same hooks
- **Cline**, **Windsurf**, **OpenCode** — same approach, may need a small config nudge
- **Anything that exposes hooks or MCP** — the MCP server bundled with Icemage is reusable

---

## 🛡️ Safety + privacy

- **100 % local.** Everything Icemage knows about your projects lives in a small SQLite database next to your code. Nothing is sent to a remote server — not the project name, not the file paths, not the recalled snippets.
- **No telemetry.** Icemage doesn't phone home.
- **Open source.** [Elastic License 2.0](LICENSE) - **source-available**. Free to use, copy, modify,
and self-host. The one limitation: you may not offer icmg to third parties as a
hosted or managed service. Everything else is fair game. Audit the binary, the release notes, and the file structure freely. Source code is held privately to keep the bug surface manageable for a solo maintainer — public reports + private fixes is the operating model.
- **Tamper-evident.** Every release ships with a `sha256` sidecar so you can verify the binary you downloaded.

---

## 🩹 Honest limits

- **Windows + Linux only** for prebuilt binaries today. macOS users currently need to wait for a self-hosted runner build (planned).
- **First-time install on Windows with strict antivirus** can be slow until you let Icemage run once. After that it's fast.
- **Not a replacement for the AI.** Icemage is a token-trimming layer — it doesn't write code for you and it doesn't make a bad AI smart.

## 💖 Support

If Icemage saved you a few hours or a few dollars and you want to send a small thank-you, both routes work:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ncmonx)
- [Ko-fi tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/ncmonx)

All revenue goes straight into more releases — there is no team behind this, just one maintainer and a long backlog of "make AI agents less wasteful" ideas.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does Icemage send my code anywhere?**
No. Everything is local. The only network call is when you ask Icemage to update itself or fetch a URL through `icmg fetch`.

**Can my company use it?**
Yes - [Elastic License 2.0](LICENSE): source-available, free for any use including commercial, self-hosting, and modification. The only limit is reselling icmg itself as a hosted/managed service. Want a private support arrangement or custom build? [Open a sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/ncmonx).

**Why is the source code repo private?**
One maintainer, no security team. Public bug reports + private fixes lets me ship hotfixes the same day without telegraphing exploitable details. The release binaries and reproducible build hash are still public.

**Does it slow my AI down?**
No. Trimming happens *before* the AI reads anything, so the AI sees a smaller, cleaner version of the same context. End-to-end interactions get faster, not slower.

**Where are the savings stored?**
In `.icmg/data.db` inside each project (small SQLite file). Run `icmg savings` to see the breakdown.

**How do I report a bug or ask for a feature?**
Open an issue at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ncmonx/icemage/issues) page. Real-world reproductions with `icmg savings --json` attached get triaged fastest.

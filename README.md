> **Stop burning tokens. Stop losing context. Ship faster.**

A single binary that makes Claude Code, Cursor, and every other AI coding assistant **70–90% cheaper** to run — without dumbing them down.

If you've ever watched 30K tokens evaporate on a single file read, paid for "thinking" you didn't need, or re-explained the same project context after `/clear` for the fifth time today — this is for you.

## 🔍 What's new in v0.53.0

| Feature | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| **BFS graph traversal (4 new cmds)** | `icmg graph path <from> <to>` — shortest dependency path; `graph layers <file> [--reverse]` — deps grouped by distance; `graph neighbors <file>` — direct 1-hop deps; `graph common <a> <b>` — shared upstream dependencies |
| **Impact edge-type filter** | `icmg graph impact <file> --edge-type imports,calls` — filter to specific edge types only |
| **Multi-source impact** | `icmg graph impact --all <f1> <f2>` — union impact from multiple files in one call |
| **DOT graph export** | `icmg graph impact <file> --format dot` — Graphviz DOT output, pipe to `dot -Tsvg` |
| **WAL bloat fix (critical)** | `wal_autocheckpoint` 1000→100 pages — prevents SQLite WAL growing to GBs under concurrent hook writers |
| **CMD popup fix (Windows)** | Task Scheduler PS1 launcher uses `ProcessStartInfo.CreateNoWindow=$true` — reliably hides console on Win11 |
| **Full command reference on init** | `icmg init` injects ~50-command reference table into `AGENTS.md` — Claude knows every command from session 1, no help queries needed |
| **Graph BFS savings tracking** | `icmg savings` includes Graph BFS row — tracks `path`/`layers`/`neighbors`/`common` calls, estimates 2000 tokens saved per call |

```bash
icmg graph path src/auth.cpp src/db.cpp          # shortest dependency path
icmg graph layers src/core/db.cpp --reverse      # who depends on this, by distance level
icmg graph neighbors src/main.cpp                # direct 1-hop dependencies
icmg graph common src/auth.cpp src/api.cpp       # shared upstream dependencies
icmg graph impact src/db.cpp --edge-type imports # filter impact by edge type
icmg graph impact src/db.cpp --format dot | dot -Tsvg > impact.svg
icmg graph impact --all src/auth.cpp src/db.cpp  # union impact of two files
icmg init --force                                 # reinstall hooks + inject full command ref
```

## 🛠️ What's new in v0.53.1

| Fix | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| **Zone glob Windows paths** | Zone patterns (`src/cli/**`) now match Windows absolute paths — nodes no longer mis-tag to `default` on Windows |
| **Doctor caveman loop** | `icmg doctor` no longer re-warns about caveman hook on every run after auto-reinstall |

```bash
icmg zone rebuild   # re-tag any mis-classified nodes after upgrade (Windows users)
```

---

## 🚀 What's new in v0.52.0

| Feature | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| **Cross-session awareness** | `icmg session claim/clear/list` writes `~/.icmg/active-work.json`; `icmg wake-up` shows concurrent tasks from other sessions on the same machine |
| **Anti-pattern sync** | `icmg fail sync-denials` converts `~/.icmg/strict-denials.jsonl` hook violations → fail memory nodes; runs automatically on session Stop |
| **Wake-up SessionStart hook** | `icmg init` now installs a SessionStart hook that injects `icmg wake-up` briefing at the start of every AI session |
| **Caveman ultra auto-on** | `icmg init` creates `~/.icmg/caveman.flag=ultra` if absent — caveman mode active on first run, no manual step |
| **Routing table complete** | AGENTS.md routing table expanded from 15 → 39 commands; topic prefix convention (`plan:`, `bug:`, `decisions-`) documented for deterministic recall |
| **Memory read perf** | `PRAGMA mmap_size=256MB` + `PRAGMA page_size=4096` in all DB opens — read-heavy workloads skip syscall overhead |

```bash
icmg session claim "working on auth refresh"   # register task for cross-session visibility
icmg wake-up                                    # now shows Active sessions block
icmg fail sync-denials                          # convert hook violations to fail memory
icmg init --force                               # gets wake-up hook + caveman flag
```

---

## ⚡ What's new in v0.51.0

| Feature | What changed |
|---|---|
| **Destructive-op guard** | `icmg run` intercepts `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `git push --force` etc. — prompts `[y/N]` before executing; `--yes` bypasses |
| **Version staleness check** | Startup checks GitHub for latest release (24h cached); warns at lag≥3, soft-blocks `init`/`graph` at lag≥10 |
| **Wake-up per-user filter** | `icmg wake-up` now filters decisions/fixes by `created_by` — multi-user machines no longer mix context |
| **Hook token efficiency** | `hook userprompt` now respects 4KB budget cap, BM25≥0.15 threshold, adaptive depth, 300s context cache, 1-hop BFS graph expansion |
| **CMD popup suppression** | `exec_utils` subprocess launch adds `STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW\|SW_HIDE` — no console flicker on all Windows configs |
| **Init security** | `icmg init` warns on OneDrive/Dropbox path + sets owner-only permissions on `.icmg/` |

```bash
icmg run --yes rm -rf build/        # skip destructive prompt for safe dirs
icmg wake-up                        # now shows [user: email] header
icmg upgrade                        # resolve version staleness warnings
```

              SAVINGS DASHBOARD + RECEIPTS + COMPLIANCE TRACKING
```

| 😤 Pain | ✅ Icmg fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| Big files inflate every prompt | Surgical context bundles — only what the task actually needs |
| Noisy command output drowns the model | Output filtering tuned per command type (ANSI strip, dedup ×N, blank collapse) |
| Same bug solved twice | Persistent memory that surfaces past fixes when they apply |
| `/clear` wipes hard-won context | Snapshots + auto-distill of session decisions |
| Models "think" 8K tokens for a one-line rename | Intent-aware directives + caveman mode kills thinking outright |
| Re-sending the same project preamble every turn | Long-lived prompt-cache markers — pay once, reuse cheap |
| 30K tokens of logs / diffs / dumps | Lossless context compression with reversible round-trips |
| AI keeps trying the same broken approach | Anti-pattern memory (`icmg fail`) — failures become guardrails |
| AI "forgets" your CLAUDE.md instructions | Hard-enforcement hooks block disallowed reads/fetches |
| Native `Read` bypasses everything | Read cap-and-allow hook caps at 30 lines + icmg-context overlay |
| Same task already solved in another project | `icmg cross-recall` federates memory across all registered projects |
| DB grows unbounded over months | `icmg cron install` autopilots weekly prune (Windows schtasks / POSIX cron) |
| Wrong zone wastes BM25 IDF | Auto-zone detect from task keywords (10 zones); no manual `--zone X` |

Each one is a few percent. Stack them and you get the headline number.

## Quick start

```bash
# Build
cmake -B build && cmake --build build

# Or grab the release binary
# https://github.com/ncmonx/icm-graph/releases

# Bootstrap a project (installs the right hooks for your AI agent)
icmg init

# Try one of these
icmg pack "fix the login bug"          # surgical context bundle
icmg run npm test                      # noise-filtered build output
icmg compress < big.log                # cut tokens on dumps + diffs
icmg pack "rename foo.ts"              # auto-think on; thinking off when task is simple
icmg context src/auth.ts --symbol parseToken  # one function body, 80%+ cut vs full file
icmg run --stream npm test             # real-time output + noise filter summary at end
icmg context src/auth.ts --lines 60-95 # surgical read; replaces native Read offset/limit
icmg fail store "jwt refresh" "X" "Y"  # record failed approach so AI doesn't repeat
icmg savings                           # see what you saved (console / --html)
```

That's it. Nothing else to configure.

## Install

**Windows (recommended):** download the latest release, drop `icmg.exe` somewhere on `PATH`. The bundled DLLs live next to it. Done.

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ncmonx/icm-graph
cd icm-graph
cmake -B build && cmake --build build
# Optional capabilities (turn on what you want)
cmake -B build -DICMG_USE_TREESITTER=ON -DICMG_USE_ONNX=ON
```

Optional capabilities are exactly that — optional. Default build runs everywhere with zero external dependencies beyond a C++17 compiler.

## 📅 How it pays off in practice

After a few days of use you'll notice:

| Milestone | What changes |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Day 1** | Sessions get visibly longer before `/compact` fires |
| **Day 3** | Recurring questions answer themselves from memory |
| **Day 7** | Big PR reviews stop blowing the context window |
| **Day 14** | Cache hit-rate climbs as you settle into patterns |
| **Day 30** | Your monthly Claude bill stops scaring you |

Memory recall sharpens over time. Snapshot restore gets faster. Compression learns your codebase's repeated terms. **The system compounds.**

## Security

Local-first design with explicit boundaries:

- **Update integrity:** every release ships a SHA256 sidecar per binary. `update --apply` verifies before swap; mismatch auto-rollbacks. Bypass via `--skip-verify`.
- **Per-DLL SHA256:** 6 bundled DLLs (onnxruntime / providers-shared / tree-sitter / wasmtime / zstd / winpthread) verified after install; auto-restore from `.bak` on mismatch.
- **URL sanitization:** `icmg fetch` validates URLs against a shell-metacharacter blocklist (`"$\;|&<>` newlines control chars) before any shell-out.
- **HTTPS-only** for self-update + fetch.
- **Parameterized SQL** queries throughout (no SQL injection on store/recall/import).
- **No telemetry phoned home** — the binary makes network calls only when you invoke `update`, `fetch`, `embed` (Python sidecar), or `whats-new`.
- **Per-project DB** is plaintext SQLite. If you store secrets as memory, treat the DB file as sensitive (filesystem permissions remain the boundary).
- **Hooks** modify `.claude/settings.local.json` only on `icmg init`. Review before opt-in.

Open caveats:
- Image OCR runs Python `pytesseract` + `Pillow` subprocess; respect those projects' CVE history when ingesting untrusted images.
- MCP stdio is unauthenticated (local-only threat model).
- DB encryption opt-in still in design (key-recovery UX risk).

## Self-repair

icmg is designed to recover from common failure modes on its own. The trade-off: recovery takes a few extra seconds in exchange for safety.

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| Update target binary locked (Windows) | Detached helper waits for the running process to exit, then performs the swap on the next invocation — no manual restart needed |
| Update integrity mismatch (sha256) | Aborts before swap, keeps the previous binary in place |
| DLL bundle drift after upgrade | Per-DLL sha256 verify catches mismatches; auto-rollback restores `.bak` |
| Stale lockfile from killed process | Auto-detected via PID liveness probe and cleaned up |
| Pending upgrade interrupted | Marker file resumes the swap on the next `icmg` invocation in any new terminal |
| Hook scripts drift after upgrade | `update --apply` re-runs `init --install-hooks --force` automatically |
| Telemetry tables grow unbounded | `icmg memory prune-telemetry` reclaims space; `prune-old --topic 'auto:%'` rotates auto-grown topics |
| DB schema lag | Migrations apply automatically on next open; backward-compatible |
| Project graph stale | `icmg context` auto-scans single file inline if not yet indexed |
| TS/MD/JSON files missing from graph | Auto-detected by extension and indexed on next access |
| **DB corruption detected** | `icmg mirror failover` swaps in newest valid mirror in seconds; primary quarantined for forensics; audit-logged |
| **No mirror available** | `icmg backup restore latest` rolls back to most recent atomic snapshot; auto-undo created first |
| **Project copied to new location (DB missing)** | `icmg backup restore-from .icmg/backups/<id>.db` — restores from explicit file; creates `.icmg/` dir if absent; `--no-undo` skips pre-restore snapshot |
| **DB heavy (>100MB or >50K rows)** | `icmg maintain run` chains telemetry-prune → topic-aged prune → decay → consolidate → integrity check |
| **Project idle (no activity >24h)** | `icmg maintain run --idle-mode` soft-deletes auto/session/cache rows below importance 2; graph + pinned memory untouched |

**Always-on protection (auto-armed on `icmg init` and every upgrade):**

| Layer | Cadence | Disk cost | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Snapshot history | hourly | pyramidal (24h/7d/4w/6m) | Time-travel recovery |
| Dual mirror | 15 min | 2× live | Instant failover |
| Hygiene maintain | 6 h | n/a | Bounded growth |
| Graph integrity | within maintain | n/a | Drift detection |

Most recovery paths take 1–3 seconds. A few (network re-fetch on integrity mismatch, helper-script wait for exit) can take 10–30 seconds. Safety is prioritized over speed — every recovery preserves the previous good state via `.bak` files so manual rollback is always available.

Run `icmg health` any time to confirm everything is in order.

## Honest limits

```
✓  Windows is primary target. Linux / macOS work but tested less.
✓  Opinionated. Fight the conventions and you fight the tool.
✓  Won't make a bad prompt good — makes a good prompt cheap.
✓  Some optional capabilities require one-time DLL download (binary tells you).
✓  Compression is semantic glossary — model still must understand aliases inline.
✓  Real session coverage starts ~50%; climbs as more hooks fire on subsequent ops.
```

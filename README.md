> **Stop burning tokens. Stop losing context. Ship faster.**

A small helper app that makes AI coding assistants — Claude Code, Cursor, and friends — **70 – 98 % cheaper** to run, without making them less helpful.

**40 MCP tools · 1138/1138 tests · single-binary · 100 % local · pure-bash hooks** (zero Python/jq dependency).

If you've ever watched a huge token bill evaporate on a single file read, paid for "thinking" you didn't need, or re-explained your project to the AI for the fifth time today — Icemage is for you.

---

## 🟢 Why Icemage

AI assistants are powerful but **wasteful by default**. Every time the AI opens a file, runs a command, or starts a new chat, it re-reads context it has seen many times and dumps full output into the conversation. Icemage sits quietly in the background and trims the noise before it ever reaches the AI:

- **Long files** → only the relevant slice
- **Noisy command output** → just the parts that matter
- **Web pages** → cached + summarised
- **Past decisions** → remembered across sessions so the AI doesn't ask twice
- **Repeated work** → results reused instead of recomputed

The AI keeps its full intelligence. Your wallet keeps more of its money.

## ✨ What's new

> **Recent releases.** Older entries archived in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

- **v1.78.2** - **`icmg bug-report` now tells you why it failed**. Issue #193 reported `sent=0 failed=13` from `icmg bug-report --send-pending` with no actionable error detail — gh CLI sometimes routes diagnostics (missing label, repo-perm issues, auth) to **stdout** instead of stderr, so the previous version printed nothing useful and kept retrying. v1.78.2 surfaces both streams (capped) plus the exit code on every failure, adds heuristic hints (`gh label create auto-report` / `gh repo view` / `gh auth login`) based on the error pattern, and aborts after 3 consecutive failures so it stops spamming. Closes #193. Also lands the **RAM-cache persist infrastructure** for v1.77's hot recall cache — Phases A–D building blocks (scope hash, write-through sink, SQLite `recall_cache_persist` table with per-project `scope_hash` isolation + UPSERT, hydrate top-N by hit_count, and `icmg memory cache persist enable/disable/status` CLI sub-cmd). Default ON; opt-out `ICMG_RECALL_CACHE_PERSIST=0` or per-project `.icmg/cache-persist.off` marker. Daemon hookup (hydrate-on-boot + write-queue sink) lands in v1.78.3. Full automated suite passes (24 new persist tests).
- **v1.78.1** - **`icmg caveman` becomes `icmg sayless` (with auto-migration)**. The directive command that compresses your AI assistant's replies has been renamed for clarity and copyright safety. The new `icmg sayless on/off/status/level` does the same job and adds a denser `hyper` level (symbol-based shorthand: `→ ⇒ ∴ ∵ Δ` + abbreviations) on top of the existing `lite/full/ultra`. Existing setups carry over automatically: old flag files (`.icmg/caveman.flag`/`.off`, `~/.icmg/caveman.flag`, `caveman-last-trigger.txt`) are auto-renamed to their `sayless.*` equivalents on the next `icmg init --force`, the stale `icmg-caveman-prompt.sh` hook is removed, and your enabled state is preserved. Env vars renamed (`ICMG_NO_SAYLESS_AUTO`, `ICMG_SAYLESS_QUIET`). Internal docs rule added: every README section now has a dedicated memoir source-of-truth, so future docs PRs only re-touch the section that changed instead of the whole README. Mono ctest suite PASSED.
- **v1.78.0** - **Fix: `icmg context` no longer crashes on some Windows Server setups**. On a Windows Server 2019 box, `icmg context <file>` failed with "The specified module could not be found" - which looked like a missing DLL but was actually the path-normalization step: the OS path API icmg's standard library uses (PathCch) didn't resolve on that machine, and the error took down the command. Other commands were unaffected because they don't canonicalize a path. icmg now uses the non-throwing path APIs and falls back to a purely-lexical normalize, so `context` works everywhere - no crash, no env vars, no lost functionality. Full automated suite passes 1138 of 1138 checks.
- **v1.77.0** - **RAM brain: recall gets faster the more you use it**. icmg now keeps recall results hot in memory - repeat recalls of the same query return from RAM in well under 5ms instead of recomputing the full-text search each time (search quality unchanged, only the recompute is skipped). When the background daemon is running, the cache lives there and is shared across sessions, so a result computed in one session is instantly available in another; when the daemon is off, each process uses its own local cache and falls back to computing - no hangs. Any memory write flushes the cache so you never see stale results, and a self-checkup RAM governor shrinks or grows the cache with available system memory while pinning your hottest entries. New `icmg memory cache stats`; opt out with `ICMG_RECALL_CACHE=0`. Full automated suite passes 1134 of 1134 checks.
- **v1.76.0** - **Encrypt your icmg databases at rest**. Your project memory, decisions, and chat transcripts live in local SQLite files - previously plaintext on disk. v1.76 adds opt-in full-database encryption (SQLCipher / AES-256): run `icmg encrypt enable` and icmg transparently encrypts the project + global DBs, while fast BM25 recall keeps working exactly as before (the whole DB is encrypted, not individual fields). OFF by default - existing DBs untouched. Three key modes: `dpapi` (default, sealed to your Windows account, no passphrase prompts), `shared` (team-readable key for shared servers), `env` (`ICMG_DB_KEY` for CI). Migration backs up, encrypts, atomically swaps, then shreds the plaintext copy; `icmg encrypt disable`/`status` round it out. Back up `~/.icmg/db.key` - losing it is unrecoverable. Full automated suite passes 1120 of 1120 checks.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Download** the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ncmonx/icm-graph/releases) — `icmg-<version>-win-x64.zip` for Windows, `icmg-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` for Linux.
2. **Extract** the archive into any folder of your choice.
3. **Add the folder to your `PATH`** so the `icmg` command is available everywhere.
4. **Open your project** in a terminal and run:

   ```text
   icmg init
   ```

   That's it. The next time you launch Claude Code (or Cursor / Cline / Windsurf — see below), Icemage will quietly start trimming tokens.

---

## 🧰 What you'll actually use day-to-day

After install, the only command most people type is `icmg init` once per project. Everything else happens automatically. A few useful commands when you want to peek under the hood:

| Want to | Type |
|---|---|
| See how much you saved this month | `icmg savings` |
| See a chart in the terminal | `icmg savings --ascii` |
| Recall a past decision in this project | `icmg recall "<question>"` |
| Recall something from another project | `icmg cross-recall "<question>"` |
| Wake-up briefing for a fresh session | `icmg wake-up` |
| Update Icemage in place | `icmg update --apply` |
| Health-check the install | `icmg doctor` |

For the full menu run `icmg --help`.

---

## 🤖 Works with

- **Claude Code** (primary target — best-tested)
- **Cursor** — drop-in via the same hooks
- **Cline**, **Windsurf**, **OpenCode** — same approach, may need a small config nudge
- **Anything that exposes hooks or MCP** — the MCP server bundled with Icemage is reusable

---

## 🛡️ Safety + privacy

- **100 % local.** Everything Icemage knows about your projects lives in a small SQLite database next to your code. Nothing is sent to a remote server — not the project name, not the file paths, not the recalled snippets.
- **No telemetry.** Icemage doesn't phone home.
- **Open source.** [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). Audit the binary, the release notes, and the file structure freely. Source code is held privately to keep the bug surface manageable for a solo maintainer — public reports + private fixes is the operating model.
- **Tamper-evident.** Every release ships with a `sha256` sidecar so you can verify the binary you downloaded.

---

## 🩹 Honest limits

- **Windows + Linux only** for prebuilt binaries today. macOS users currently need to wait for a self-hosted runner build (planned).
- **First-time install on Windows with strict antivirus** can be slow until you let Icemage run once. After that it's fast.
- **Not a replacement for the AI.** Icemage is a token-trimming layer — it doesn't write code for you and it doesn't make a bad AI smart.

## 💖 Support

If Icemage saved you a few hours or a few dollars and you want to send a small thank-you, both routes work:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ncmonx)
- [Ko-fi tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/ncmonx)

All revenue goes straight into more releases — there is no team behind this, just one maintainer and a long backlog of "make AI agents less wasteful" ideas.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does Icemage send my code anywhere?**
No. Everything is local. The only network call is when you ask Icemage to update itself or fetch a URL through `icmg fetch`.

**Can my company use it?**
Yes — Apache-2.0 licensed, free for any use including commercial. If you want a private support arrangement or a custom build, [open a sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/ncmonx).

**Why is the source code repo private?**
One maintainer, no security team. Public bug reports + private fixes lets me ship hotfixes the same day without telegraphing exploitable details. The release binaries and reproducible build hash are still public.

**Does it slow my AI down?**
No. Trimming happens *before* the AI reads anything, so the AI sees a smaller, cleaner version of the same context. End-to-end interactions get faster, not slower.

**Where are the savings stored?**
In `.icmg/data.db` inside each project (small SQLite file). Run `icmg savings` to see the breakdown.

**How do I report a bug or ask for a feature?**
Open an issue at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ncmonx/icm-graph/issues) page. Real-world reproductions with `icmg savings --json` attached get triaged fastest.

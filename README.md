> **Stop burning tokens. Stop losing context. Ship faster.**

A small helper app that makes AI coding assistants — Claude Code, Cursor, and friends — **70 – 98 % cheaper** to run, without making them less helpful.

**40 MCP tools · 124/124 tests · single-binary · 100 % local · pure-bash hooks** (zero Python/jq dependency).

If you've ever watched a huge token bill evaporate on a single file read, paid for "thinking" you didn't need, or re-explained your project to the AI for the fifth time today — Icemage is for you.

---

## 🟢 Why Icemage

AI assistants are powerful but **wasteful by default**. Every time the AI opens a file, runs a command, or starts a new chat, it re-reads context it has seen many times and dumps full output into the conversation. Icemage sits quietly in the background and trims the noise before it ever reaches the AI:

- **Long files** → only the relevant slice
- **Noisy command output** → just the parts that matter
- **Web pages** → cached + summarised
- **Past decisions** → remembered across sessions so the AI doesn't ask twice
- **Repeated work** → results reused instead of recomputed

The AI keeps its full intelligence. Your wallet keeps more of its money.

## ✨ What's new

> **Recent releases.** Older entries archived in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

- **v1.55.0** - **5 quality-of-life upgrades for AI-assisted coding sessions**. AI now sees an opening greeting once per session instead of every turn, cutting wasted tokens by ~90% on follow-up messages. AI also gets a quiet nudge each prompt suggesting the next sensible step ("you have uncommitted work", "build had errors", "this looks like something you've solved before") with one cheap check per prompt; turn off with `ICMG_NO_ADVISOR=1`. Code understanding for Go, Rust, Java, and C++ projects is now structural (real parsing) instead of regex guessing, so symbol navigation and impact analysis stay accurate even on dense codebases. New community-detection command `icmg graph cluster` groups related files into clusters, useful for finding hidden modules. Finally, a new helper `icmg-patch` lets the AI edit files in one shot instead of dropping temporary scripts everywhere - cleaner workspaces, fewer leftover files.
- **v1.54.0** - **Smart router auto-hint + 100% test pass + build infra**. UserPromptSubmit hook now injects routing hint (`[router-hint] route=LOCAL/CLOUD/CACHE`) every prompt, so Claude knows when to delegate to local LLM vs cloud. ctest baseline 736 PASS -> 913 PASS (100%) by adding `/WHOLEARCHIVE:icmg_lib` to MSVC test build (was dropping static-init macros). Build infra: log every build to `~/.icmg/build-logs/` + 30s dedup window (`icmg-build-log show|error|tail`), Edit-Intent allowlist for Read-cap bypass (`icmg-edit-prep <file>` before Edit). Bonus: ICMG_SKIP_RC env-gate bypasses cmake-ninja RC depfile quirk.
- **v1.53.0** - **Smart router + interactive NL disambig + warm-loop polish + critical fixes**. New `icmg route classify <prompt>` CLI classifies LOCAL/CLOUD/CACHE for routing decisions. Chat REPL now handles ambiguous fuzzy match interactively: lists candidates `1..N`, reply with number to execute. Warm-loop daemon: `active_clients` counter RAII fix + chat auto-skips in-process WarmPool when daemon owns model (no more RAM-guard spurious fail). Critical: `icmg context` no longer triggers spurious rescan every call (file_clock vs system_clock epoch fix). `icmg graph update` no longer crashes on non-ASCII paths (Chinese filenames in plugin caches now skipped gracefully). 26 + 6 new unit tests.
- **v1.52.0** - **Cross-process warm-loop daemon eliminates LLM cold-load**. New CLI: `icmg llm warm --start | --stop | --status` spawns a detached daemon holding the model in memory. Chat replies in ~10s wall vs ~30s cold-load on Dolphin 8B Q4_K_M (T2000 4GB GPU). Named pipe IPC at `\\.\pipe\icmg-llm-warm`, JSON newline protocol (ping/status/infer/shutdown), 4 concurrent pipe instances. Carries v1.51 LLM tuning: repetition penalty (`repeat_penalty=1.15`), `max_tokens` bumped to 8192 in chat_cmd, n_ctx 5120 sweet spot, history seed `15 -> 0` default. Plus: `icmg skill index --dir` Unicode crash fix (pathToUtf8). 8 unit + 3 integration tests green.
- **v1.51.1** - **Hotfix: backends re-enabled**. v1.51.0 shipped accidentally with `ICMG_USE_LLAMA/ONNX/TREESITTER/GGML_VULKAN` all OFF — chat REPL fell through to agent instead of using local Qwen 7B. v1.51.1 rebuilds with full backends ON + fixes `icmg --help/--version` (was hardcoded \"0.37.0\"). All v1.51.0 NL manage features intact: `hapus rule X`, `tambah skill Y`, fuzzy resolver, soft-disable.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Download** the latest installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ncmonx/icm-graph/releases) — `icmg-<version>-win-x64.zip` for Windows, `icmg-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` for Linux.
2. **Extract** the archive into any folder of your choice.
3. **Add the folder to your `PATH`** so the `icmg` command is available everywhere.
4. **Open your project** in a terminal and run:

   ```text
   icmg init
   ```

   That's it. The next time you launch Claude Code (or Cursor / Cline / Windsurf — see below), Icemage will quietly start trimming tokens.

---

## 🧰 What you'll actually use day-to-day

After install, the only command most people type is `icmg init` once per project. Everything else happens automatically. A few useful commands when you want to peek under the hood:

| Want to | Type |
|---|---|
| See how much you saved this month | `icmg savings` |
| See a chart in the terminal | `icmg savings --ascii` |
| Recall a past decision in this project | `icmg recall "<question>"` |
| Recall something from another project | `icmg cross-recall "<question>"` |
| Wake-up briefing for a fresh session | `icmg wake-up` |
| Update Icemage in place | `icmg update --apply` |
| Health-check the install | `icmg doctor` |

For the full menu run `icmg --help`.

---

## 🤖 Works with

- **Claude Code** (primary target — best-tested)
- **Cursor** — drop-in via the same hooks
- **Cline**, **Windsurf**, **OpenCode** — same approach, may need a small config nudge
- **Anything that exposes hooks or MCP** — the MCP server bundled with Icemage is reusable

---

## 🛡️ Safety + privacy

- **100 % local.** Everything Icemage knows about your projects lives in a small SQLite database next to your code. Nothing is sent to a remote server — not the project name, not the file paths, not the recalled snippets.
- **No telemetry.** Icemage doesn't phone home.
- **Open source.** [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). Audit the binary, the release notes, and the file structure freely. Source code is held privately to keep the bug surface manageable for a solo maintainer — public reports + private fixes is the operating model.
- **Tamper-evident.** Every release ships with a `sha256` sidecar so you can verify the binary you downloaded.

---

## 🩹 Honest limits

- **Windows + Linux only** for prebuilt binaries today. macOS users currently need to wait for a self-hosted runner build (planned).
- **First-time install on Windows with strict antivirus** can be slow until you let Icemage run once. After that it's fast.
- **Not a replacement for the AI.** Icemage is a token-trimming layer — it doesn't write code for you and it doesn't make a bad AI smart.

---

## 💖 Support

If Icemage saved you a few hours or a few dollars and you want to send a small thank-you, both routes work:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ncmonx)
- [Ko-fi tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/ncmonx)

All revenue goes straight into more releases — there is no team behind this, just one maintainer and a long backlog of "make AI agents less wasteful" ideas.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Does Icemage send my code anywhere?**
No. Everything is local. The only network call is when you ask Icemage to update itself or fetch a URL through `icmg fetch`.

**Can my company use it?**
Yes — Apache-2.0 licensed, free for any use including commercial. If you want a private support arrangement or a custom build, [open a sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/ncmonx).

**Why is the source code repo private?**
One maintainer, no security team. Public bug reports + private fixes lets me ship hotfixes the same day without telegraphing exploitable details. The release binaries and reproducible build hash are still public.

**Does it slow my AI down?**
No. Trimming happens *before* the AI reads anything, so the AI sees a smaller, cleaner version of the same context. End-to-end interactions get faster, not slower.

**Where are the savings stored?**
In `.icmg/data.db` inside each project (small SQLite file). Run `icmg savings` to see the breakdown.

**How do I report a bug or ask for a feature?**
Open an issue at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ncmonx/icm-graph/issues) page. Real-world reproductions with `icmg savings --json` attached get triaged fastest.
